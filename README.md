This is the MATLAB implementation of analtical form of the expected hypervolume improvement in 2-dimensions from the paper: Yang, K., Emmerich, M., Deutz, A. et al. Efficient computation of expected hypervolume improvement using box decomposition algorithms. J Glob Optim 75, 3â€“34 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10898-019-00798-7

For more than 2 dimensions, you can use Monte Carlo Approximation provided in the code.
